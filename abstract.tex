When you are browsing the Web with your favorite Web browser what do you consider a slow page loading speed? Not only does this question come up during the development of said browser, but it is one that has piqued particular scientific interest. And the potential answers to that question can be rather faceted.
This work investigates existing metrics that quantify page load times in different fashions. We achieve this by comparing those metrics for Web pages of different categories (e.g. news/blog/text entries, lists/search results, landing pages) in a measurement series across different browsers. This is further elaborated on by a theoretical analysis of the effects and implications of Web speed metrics. Finally we set first foundations to extend these metrics towards the inclusion of user-specific and subjective factors on a road to obtain a measure for Web \gls{QoE}.
